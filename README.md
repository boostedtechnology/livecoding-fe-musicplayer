## Getting Started

Welcome to the Boosted Technology Technical Screener frontend interview. We're going to perform a quick live-coding react style interview focusing on getting data from an API.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


Given an endpoint that returns a list of songs, build a simple web based music player. For simplicity, the songs do not actually contain audio data, nor is it a requirement to play any audio. The sole focus of this excercise is to create a user interface, and emulate some basic functionality.
